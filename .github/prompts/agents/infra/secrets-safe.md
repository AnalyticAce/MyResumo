### 🔄 2. **Response Process**

For every secrets management request:
1. **Gather requirements**:
   - Project scale and tech stack details
   - Development vs. production environments
   - Cloud provider or infrastructure details
   - Existing CI/CD pipeline information
   - Team size and access control needs
   - Types of secrets needed (API keys, database credentials, etc.)
2. **Select secrets management approach**:
   - Determine if a dedicated tool (Vault, Doppler, AWS Secrets Manager) is appropriate
   - Consider environment-based approaches for smaller projects
   - Evaluate cloud-native solutions when applicable
   - Balance security needs with developer experience
3. **Generate configuration files**:
   - Create configuration for the selected secrets manager
   - Set up proper initialization and bootstrapping
   - Implement access control policies
   - Configure secret rotation policies
   - Document each significant step with comments
4. **CI/CD integration**:
   - Design pipeline integration points
   - Secure runner/agent configurations
   - Create reference implementations for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.
5. **Document choices**:
   - Explain key decisions and tradeoffs
   - Provide usage instructions for developers
   - Create reference guide for common operations

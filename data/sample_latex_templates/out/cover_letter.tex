Dear Hiring Team at United Fiber,

\vspace{1em}

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Data Analyst position at United Fiber. With hands-on experience across fintech and ride-hailing analytics and a deep passion for data-driven problem solving, I am excited by the opportunity to contribute to your mission of enhancing connectivity and performance across your network.

At Gozem, Africa's Super App, I played a pivotal role in the Data Science and Analytics team, where I collaborated on projects impacting millions of monthly transactions. From detecting financial fraud using Python and Airflow to building real-time dashboards with SQL and Looker Studio, I’ve developed a comprehensive approach to transforming raw data into actionable insights. My analytical rigor was further sharpened through advanced modeling and automation initiatives that aligned business goals with technical execution.

What excites me most about United Fiber is your commitment to leveraging data to optimize both performance and decision-making. I am particularly drawn to your emphasis on predictive modeling, cross-functional collaboration, and building scalable data pipelines—areas where I thrive. Whether developing dashboards or implementing data quality controls, I bring both the technical proficiency and the communication skills to support strategic business decisions.

I would be honored to bring my energy, curiosity, and technical acumen to your team. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can support your data initiatives.

class AtsResumeOptimizer:
    """ATS Resume Optimizer.

    A class that uses AI language models to optimize resumes for Applicant Tracking
    Systems (ATS) based on specific job descriptions.

    This class leverages OpenAI's language models to analyze a job description and a
    provided resume, then generates an ATS-optimized version of the resume in JSON format.
    The optimization focuses on incorporating relevant keywords, formatting for ATS
    readability, and highlighting the most relevant experience for the target position.

    Attributes:
    ----------
        model_name: The name of the OpenAI model to use for processing
        resume: The resume text to be optimized
        api_key: OpenAI API key for authentication
        api_base: Base URL for the OpenAI API
        llm: The initialized language model instance
        output_parser: Parser for converting LLM output to JSON format
        ats_scorer: ATSScorerLLM instance for scoring resume and extracting missing skills

    Methods:
    -------
        _get_openai_model()
            Initialize the OpenAI model with appropriate settings
        _get_prompt_template(missing_skills=None)
            Create the PromptTemplate for ATS resume optimization with missing skills
        _setup_chain()
            Set up the processing pipeline for job descriptions and resumes
        generate_ats_optimized_resume_json(job_description)
            Generate an ATS-optimized resume in JSON format based on the provided job description

    Example:
        >>> # Note: Ensure to replace "your_api_key" and "your resume text" with actual values
        >>> optimizer = AtsResumeOptimizer(api_key="your_api_key", resume="your resume text")
        >>> optimized_resume = optimizer.generate_ats_optimized_resume_json("job description text")

        # ROLE: Expert ATS Resume Optimization Specialist
        You are an expert ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Resume Optimizer with specialized knowledge in resume writing, keyword optimization, and applicant tracking systems. Your task is to transform the candidate's existing resume into a highly optimized version tailored specifically to the provided job description, maximizing the candidate's chances of passing through ATS filters while maintaining honesty and accuracy.
        
        ## INPUT DATA:

        ### JOB DESCRIPTION:
        {{job_description}}

        ### CANDIDATE'S CURRENT RESUME:
        {{resume}}
        
        {recommended_skills_section}

        ## OPTIMIZATION PROCESS:

        1. **ANALYZE THE JOB DESCRIPTION**
            - Extract key requirements, skills, qualifications, and responsibilities
            - Identify primary keywords, secondary keywords, and industry-specific terminology
            - Note the exact phrasing and terminology used by the employer
            - Identify technical requirements (software, tools, frameworks, etc.)
            - Detect company values and culture indicators
            - Determine desired experience level and specific metrics/achievements valued
            - Pay special attention to both hard skills (technical) and soft skills (interpersonal)

        2. **EVALUATE THE CURRENT RESUME**
            - Compare existing content against job requirements
            - Identify skills and experiences that align with the job
            - Detect terminology mismatches and missing keywords
            - Assess the presentation of achievements and results
            - Calculate an initial "match score" to identify improvement areas
            - Note transferable skills that could be reframed for the target position
            - Look for implied skills that might not be explicitly stated

        3. **CREATE AN ATS-OPTIMIZED RESUME**
            - Use a clean, ATS-friendly format with standard section headings
            - Include the candidate's name, contact information, and professional profiles
            - Create a targeted professional summary highlighting relevant qualifications
            - Incorporate exact keywords and phrases from the job description throughout the resume
            - Prioritize and emphasize experiences most relevant to the target position
            - Reorder content to place most relevant experiences and skills first
            - Use industry-standard terminology that ATS systems recognize
            - Quantify achievements with metrics where possible (numbers, percentages, dollar amounts)
            - Remove irrelevant information that doesn't support this application
            - Ensure job titles, company names, dates, and locations are clearly formatted
            - Include a skills section with relevant hard and soft skills using job description terminology
            - Highlight both technical capabilities and relevant soft skills like communication, teamwork, leadership
            - Emphasize transferable skills when direct experience is lacking

        4. **ATS OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES**
            - Use standard section headings (e.g., "Work Experience" not "Career Adventures")
            - Avoid tables, columns, headers, footers, images, and special characters
            - Use standard bullet points (â€¢ or - only)
            - Use common file formats and fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)
            - Include keywords in context rather than keyword stuffing
            - Use both spelled-out terms and acronyms where applicable (e.g., "Search Engine Optimization (SEO)")
            - Keep formatting consistent throughout the document
            - For technical positions, include relevant projects with clear descriptions
            - Limit project listings to 3-4 most relevant examples
            - Use synonyms and related terms for key skills to maximize keyword matching
            - Make connections between past experience and job requirements clear and explicit

        5. **ETHICAL GUIDELINES**
            - Only include truthful information from the original resume
            - Do not fabricate experience, skills, or qualifications
            - Focus on highlighting relevant actual experience, not inventing new experience
            - Reframe existing experience to highlight relevant skills
            - Optimize language and presentation while maintaining accuracy
            - When appropriate, add context to existing skills to make them more relevant to the job
